                        The Community Chronicle began in 2021 by our founder,
                        Nikhil Kotta, as a collection of favorite economic
                        cartography maps illustrating socioeconomic nequalities
                        and has since evolved into a comprehensive platform
                        focused on helping female veterans and low-income women
                        navigate post-service economic challenges.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Through our efforts, we have grown a strong, active
                        readership and community committed to financial literacy
                        and equity.
